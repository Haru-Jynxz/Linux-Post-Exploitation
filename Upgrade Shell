Once you gain access to a target you may notice that the shell is not very interactive, we should always look to upgrade shells where possible

cat /etc/shells (You should be able to cat this file in the non interactive prompt before doing an upgrade so you know which shell is installed)
/bin/bash -i (upgrades to bash session) (Bash must be installed for this)

python --version (checks python version) (If python is installed you can also spawn a shell like below)
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

perl --help (checks if installed) (Can also spawn this way)
perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
perl -e "/bin/bash";

ruby: exec "/bin/bash"

**One thing you really want to do after gaining an interactive shell is checking env variables**
env
**Ensure there is a path env variable specified used to search for a binary when you type in a command**
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
